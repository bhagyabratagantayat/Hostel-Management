## 3. Environment Configuration

### Backend (.env — never committed)
```
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=<secret>
DB_NAME=hostel_management
JWT_SECRET=<secret>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=qqv22ppu
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<secret>
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://<key>:<secret>@qqv22ppu
```

### Frontend (.env — never committed)
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

### .env.example files
Both backend and frontend have `.env.example` files with placeholder values — these ARE committed and serve as setup templates.

### .gitignore
```
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```
This pattern protects all env variants while keeping `.env.example` trackable.

## 8. Statistics Formulas

### Attendance
```
Present    = active students with status='PRESENT' today
Absent     = active students with status='ABSENT' today
Not Marked = active students - students with ANY attendance record today

Attendance % = Present / (Present + Absent) × 100
             = 0 if nobody marked yet (never treat missing as absent)

Precision: 2 decimal places
```

### Occupancy
```
Usable Beds  = Occupied + Available  (excludes Maintenance)
Occupancy %  = Occupied / Usable Beds × 100
             = 0 if Usable Beds = 0

Precision: 2 decimal places
```

## 9. Frontend Routing

| Path | Role | Component |
|------|------|-----------|
| `/` | Any | RoleRedirect → role dashboard |
| `/login` | Public | Login |
| `/admin/dashboard` | SUPER_ADMIN | AdminDashboard |
| `/admin/hostels` | SUPER_ADMIN | HostelsPage |
| `/admin/hostels/:id` | SUPER_ADMIN | HostelDetailsPage |

## 10. Security & Configuration Decisions

1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: JWT stored in HttpOnly cookie (no XSS access).
2. **SameSite Lax + Secure**: CSRF protection, HTTPS-only in production.
3. **Role enforcement on backend**: Frontend role checks are UX only. All data scoping happens server-side via `req.user.role`.
4. **Superintendent scoping**: `getAssignedHostels(userId)` always queried from DB, never trusted from client.
5. **No secrets in frontend**: Only `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is exposed to the browser.
6. **Login rate limiting**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP.
7. **Parameterized queries**: All SQL uses `mysql2/promise` placeholders.
8. **Helmet.js**: Secure HTTP headers on all responses.

## 12. Project Change Log

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 8) — Complaint & Grievance Management System**
  * **Objective**: Build an end-to-end complaint system enabling students to log room/hostel maintenance issues and staff to track, assign, resolve, comment, and audit status changes.
  * **Database Schema**:
    * Created `complaints` table (id, student_id, hostel_id, room_number, bed_number, title, description, category, priority, status, assigned_to, resolution, resolved_at, closed_at, timestamps).
    * Created `complaint_history` audit log table (complaint_id, changed_by, old_status, new_status, comment, created_at).
    * Created `complaint_comments` table (complaint_id, user_id, comment, is_internal, created_at).
    * Validated indexes on `(hostel_id, status)`, `(student_id, status)`, `(category)`, and `(assigned_to)`.
  * **Backend Service & API (`complaintService.js`, `complaintController.js`, `complaintRoutes.js`)**:
    * Enforced transaction-based status updates with history recording (`OPEN` ➔ `IN_PROGRESS` ➔ `RESOLVED` / `CLOSED` / `REOPENED`).
    * Role-aware scoping: Students only access their own complaints; Superintendents are restricted to assigned hostels; Super Admins have global access.
    * Mandated `resolution` text for marking complaints as `RESOLVED`.
    * Restricted internal comments (`is_internal: true`) to hostel staff only.
  * **Frontend UI Components & Pages**:
    * `ComplaintCard.jsx`: Displays category icon, status pill, priority tag, relative time, and student/hostel details.
    * `ComplaintFormModal.jsx`: Mobile-friendly modal for student complaint creation with category and priority selectors.
    * `ComplaintDetailsModal.jsx`: Comprehensive detail modal with status management transitions, self-assignment, internal note toggle, comment list, and timeline audit log.
    * `RecentComplaintsSection.jsx`: Integrated into Admin, Superintendent, and Student dashboards with KPI summary cards.
    * `ComplaintsPage.jsx`: Filterable page with status tabs, category/priority drop-downs, search bar, and role-appropriate actions.
  * **Testing & Mock DB**:
    * Updated `backend/src/config/db.js` mock database engine for complaint queries and transactions.
    * Verified via `test_phase8_complaints.js` (12/12 integration tests passed).
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 7.5) — Notice System Production Verification & Data Safety**
  * **Database Verification Result**: LOCAL DATABASE NOT VERIFIED (Local MySQL server on port 3307 offline; mock DB fallback verified 100% compliant with SQL schema & security filters).
  * **Migration File**: Created `database/migrations/phase7_notices.sql` with safe `IF NOT EXISTS` DDL for `notices` and `notice_reads` tables, foreign keys, and indexes.
  * **Notice Visibility & Scoping Security**: Verified server-side scoping rules. Students see only All-Hostels and assigned hostel notices. Superintendents are blocked (403) from creating All-Hostels notices or managing unassigned hostel notices.
  * **Draft & Expiration Security**: Verified `DRAFT` and expired (`expires_at <= NOW()`) notices are strictly excluded from student queries, recent notices, and unread counts.
  * **Read/Unread & IDOR**: Verified `POST /api/notices/:id/read` is idempotent using `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. IDOR attempts by students accessing unassigned hostel notices return 403 Forbidden. Client-supplied user identity in read requests is ignored in favor of JWT identity.
  * **XSS & Input Validation**: Verified React text bindings render titles and descriptions safely without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Validated input sanitization for invalid priority, status, target, and length constraints.
  * **Dashboard Isolation & Sidebar**: Verified dashboard overview stats remain functional even if notice aggregation fails. Formatted sidebar unread badge to display `99+` when unread count exceeds 99.
  * **Performance & Security**: Parameterized SQL queries used (`LIKE ?`). Clamped pagination `limit` parameter to 100 max. Zero N+1 queries.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 7) — Hostel Notice & Communication System**
  * **Backend Implementation**:
    * Created `notices` and `notice_reads` SQL schema tables with indexes and ENUM priority/status support.
    * Developed `noticeService.js`, `noticeController.js`, and `noticeRoutes.js` supporting full CRUD, scope-based filtering (ALL_HOSTELS vs SPECIFIC_HOSTEL), read tracking, and unread notice aggregation.
    * Integrated recent notice retrieval into `dashboardService.js` and expanded mock engine fallback to support notice operations.
  * **Frontend Implementation**:
    * Created `NoticeCard.jsx` with priority icons, target tags, and read status badges.
    * Created `NoticeComposerModal.jsx` with hostel selector, date validation, priority setting, and character limits.
    * Created `NoticeDetailsModal.jsx` with safe plain-text rendering and automatic student read marking upon view.
    * Created `RecentNoticesSection.jsx` integrated into Admin, Superintendent, and Student Dashboards.
    * Created `NoticesPage.jsx` complete with search, priority filter, target filter, status filter, student read-state filter, and pagination.
    * Created `StudentDashboard.jsx` featuring welcome banner, unread alert card, quick tiles, and recent notices.
    * Updated `Sidebar.jsx` with Notice navigation item and dynamic unread badge bubble.
  * **Verification**: All backend notice integration tests passed and frontend built with 0 errors.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 6.5) — Dashboard Verification, Polish & Production Hardening**
  * **Bugs Fixed**:
    * `frontend/.env` had wrong port `5000` → fixed to `5001`
    * Superintendent overall stats were college-wide (unscoped) → fixed to use hostel-scoped SQL
    * N+1 query: hostel name fetched separately per hostel → merged into single hostel list query
    * Hostel loop was sequential → converted to `Promise.all()` for parallel execution
    * `notMarked` calculation used separate query → merged into single attendance aggregation
    * `AttendanceChart`/`OccupancySummary` had no empty state → added proper empty messages
    * Sidebar Dashboard link went to `/` → now routes to `/admin/dashboard` or `/superintendent/dashboard`
    * Root `/` route showed `DashboardPlaceholder` for all roles → added `RoleRedirect` component
    * `.gitignore` missing `!.env.example` → fixed env pattern
  * **Security Changes**:
    * Confirmed no backend secrets exposed to frontend
    * `.gitignore` now uses `.env.*` wildcard + `!.env.example`
  * **UI Changes**:
    * `StatCard`: added `loading` skeleton, `subtitle`, `color` variants, aria labels
    * `AttendanceChart`: rebuilt as accessible segmented bar with legend and empty state
    * `OccupancySummary`: rebuilt with color dots, proper empty state, `occupancyPercentage` prop
    * `HostelCard`: full stat display (students, attendance, rooms, beds, occupancy), semantic HTML
    * `AdminDashboard`: skeleton loading, quick actions, hostel filter, error/retry UX
    * `SuperintendentDashboard`: same polish, scoped filter (hides if 1 hostel)
  * **Formula Decisions**:
    * Attendance %: `Present / (Present + Absent) × 100` — missing = not absent
    * Occupancy %: `Occupied / (Occupied + Available) × 100` — excludes maintenance
    * All percentages: 2 decimal places via `parseFloat(x.toFixed(2))`
  * **Performance**:
    * Dashboard uses `Promise.all()` for parallel per-hostel queries
    * Overall aggregation consolidated into parallel queries
  * **Routing**:
    * Added `attendance` placeholder routes for admin and superintendent
    * `RoleRedirect` at root sends users to role-specific dashboard
* **2026-08-23 (Phase 15) — System Activity & Audit Center**
  * **Objective**: Designed and implemented a centralized operational activity and audit logging system (`activity_log`) distinct from Phase 14's `security_audit_log`. Captured operational history across all core business modules (Authentication, Users, Students, Hostels, Attendance, Notices, Complaints, Visitors, Mess, Fees, Allocations).
  * **Database Architecture**: Created `activity_log` table with indexes on `(module, created_at)`, `(actor_id, created_at)`, `(hostel_id, created_at)`, `(student_id, created_at)`, and `(entity_type, entity_id)`.
  * **Backend Audit Layer**: Developed `activityService.js`, `activityController.js`, and `activityRoutes.js`. Integrated `activityService.logActivity` across business services (`authService`, `userService`, `studentService`, `noticeService`, `complaintService`, `visitorService`, `messService`, `feeService`, `allocationService`).
  * **Transactional & Privacy Safety**: Connected logging to active database transaction connections where applicable (`logActivity(..., connection)`). Automated metadata sanitization (`sanitizeMetadata`) to scrub passwords, tokens, API keys, and mask PII fields (Aadhaar, SSN, Passport).
  * **Role-Based Access & Scoping**: Enforced strict RBAC (Super Admin = cross-hostel view, Superintendent = assigned hostels view only, Student = blocked from activity audit APIs).
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Built `ActivityFilterBar.jsx`, `ActivityDetailsModal.jsx`, `ActivityTimeline.jsx`, `ActivityPage.jsx`, and `RecentActivity.jsx` widget. Embedded widget into `AdminDashboard` and `SuperintendentDashboard`. Added "Activity Log" link to `Sidebar.jsx`.
  * **Verification**: Authored automated test script `test_phase15_activity.js` validating statistics, paginated list querying, module filtering, detail fetching, and role-scoped hostel isolation.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 14) — User Management, Authentication & Security Hardening**
  * **Objective**: Hardened the identity, authentication, user account management, and security audit layer.
  * **Database Architecture**: Added `must_change_password` and `last_login_at` to `users`. Created `security_audit_log` table storing audit events.
  * **Security & Authentication**:
    * Password complexity enforcement (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit).
    * Forced initial password change workflow (`must_change_password`).
    * Real-time `status = 'ACTIVE'` session verification in `authMiddleware.js`.
    * Privacy scrubbing in `securityService.js` to strip passwords/tokens from audit logs.
    * Self-deactivation and last Super Admin demotion protection in `userService.js`.
  * **User Administration**:
    * Created REST endpoints `/api/users`, `/api/profile`, and `/api/security/audit`.
    * Superintendent hostel scoping controls (`superintendent_hostels`).
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Built `UserManagementPage.jsx`, `SecurityAuditPage.jsx`, `ProfilePage.jsx`, and `ForcePasswordChangeModal.jsx`.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/test_phase14_security.js`. All 12/12 automated security tests passed.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 13) — Student Allocation, Room/Bed Transfer & Checkout Management System**
  * **Objective**: Implemented student accommodation lifecycle (Allocation → Transfer → Checkout) with immutable historical integrity, database-level uniqueness constraints, and transaction safety.
  * **Database Architecture**: Created `student_allocations` table with virtual columns (`active_student_key`, `active_bed_key`) and `UNIQUE` indexes guaranteeing strictly 1 active allocation per student and bed.
  * **Backend Service**: Developed `allocationService.js`, `allocationController.js`, and `allocationRoutes.js` with atomic transactions (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) and diagnostic consistency tool (`/api/allocations/consistency`).
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Created `AllocationModal.jsx`, `TransferModal.jsx`, `CheckoutModal.jsx`, `AllocationDetailsModal.jsx`, `AllocationsPage.jsx`, and `StudentAccommodationPage.jsx`.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/test_phase13_allocations.js`. All 12/12 automated integration tests passed.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 12) — Reports & Analytics Center**
  * **Objective**: Designed and implemented a centralized, read-only Reports & Analytics Center combining data across Students, Hostels, Rooms, Beds, Attendance, Complaints, Visitors, Mess, and Fees.
  * **Architecture & Services**:
    * Created `reportService.js`, `reportController.js`, and `reportRoutes.js`.
    * No Phase 12 database tables added. All reporting calculations read directly from existing tables.
    * Server-side authorization and hostel scoping (Super Admin = cross-hostel, Superintendent = assigned hostels only, Student = blocked from admin report APIs).
    * Server-side date range validation (`YYYY-MM-DD`, `date_from <= date_to`, max 365 days range).
    * `DECIMAL`-safe SQL aggregation calculations for financial fee collections.
  * **API Endpoints**:
    * `GET /api/reports/overview`: Consolidated high-level KPIs.
    * `GET /api/reports/students`: Branch, Course, Year, and Hostel student distribution.
    * `GET /api/reports/attendance`: Daily attendance trends and hostel comparisons.
    * `GET /api/reports/occupancy`: Total beds, occupied/available/maintenance breakdowns, and hostel-wise occupancy rates.
    * `GET /api/reports/complaints`: Resolution rates, category/priority breakdowns, and daily inflow trends.
    * `GET /api/reports/visitors`: Visit status breakdowns, visitor relations, and daily visitor volume trends.
    * `GET /api/reports/mess`: Meal participation rates by meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner).
    * `GET /api/reports/fees`: Expected, collected, pending, overdue, waived totals, collection rates, and daily revenue trends.
  * **Frontend UI Components**:
* **2026-08-26 (Phase 18) — Cloud Deployment & Institutional Branding**
  * **Objective**: Successfully set up multi-cloud production deployment (Firebase Hosting for Frontend, Render for Backend, Hostinger for MySQL) and applied official BEC College branding across the entire portal.
  * **Frontend Cloud Hosting (Firebase)**: Configured `frontend/firebase.json` with SPA catch-all rewrite (`**` → `/index.html`) and `frontend/.firebaserc` pointing to project `bechostels`. Live at `https://bechostels.web.app`.
  * **Backend Cloud Service (Render)**: Set up Node.js service targeting `backend/` directory with `npm install` build step and `node src/app.js` entrypoint. Cloud database connection to Hostinger MySQL (`srv1334.hstgr.io:3306`).
  * **Security & CORS Enforcement**: Updated `backend/src/app.js` to whitelist `https://bechostels.web.app`, `https://bechostels.firebaseapp.com`, and `FRONTEND_URL` in production while preserving local Vite dev ports.
  * **Institutional Branding**: Integrated official `BEC LOGO FINAL.png` into `Navbar.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, and as browser tab favicon in `frontend/index.html` via `favicon.png`.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 16) — Hostel Operations, Maintenance & Daily Task Management**
  * **Objective**: Designed and implemented the complete daily hostel operations, maintenance ticket management, and room inspection tracking system with state-machine workflow enforcement and security audit logging.
  * **Database Architecture**: Created `maintenance_requests`, `maintenance_updates`, and `room_inspections` tables with index optimization on `(hostel_id, status)`, `(student_id, status)`, and `(room_id, inspection_date)`.
  * **Workflow & State Machine**: Implemented status state machine (`OPEN` → `ASSIGNED` / `IN_PROGRESS` → `RESOLVED` → `CLOSED`, with student `REOPENED` workflow). Guarded priority elevation (`LOW`/`MEDIUM`/`HIGH` for students; `URGENT` restricted to staff or staff elevation).
  * **Location Validation & IDOR Protection**: Enforced strict location hierarchy checking (`hostel` → `floor` → `room` → `bed`) and role scoping (students see own requests/allocations; superintendents see assigned hostels).
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Built `MaintenancePage.jsx`, `InspectionsPage.jsx`, `OperationsDashboardPage.jsx`, `MaintenanceFormModal.jsx`, `MaintenanceDetailsModal.jsx`, `InspectionFormModal.jsx`, and `InspectionHistoryModal.jsx`. Updated `Sidebar.jsx` and `App.jsx` with operational route management.
  * **Activity Log Integration**: Integrated all maintenance creation, status changes, assignments, priority shifts, and room inspection events into Phase 15 `activity_log` under module `OPERATIONS`.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/scripts/test_phase16_operations.js`. All 24/24 automated operational audit tests passed successfully.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 17) — Master Data Management & Data Integrity Center**

  * **Safety & Data Consistency**: Enforced relational integrity guards preventing deactivation or deletion of entities with active dependencies (occupied beds, active allocations, open maintenance).
  * **Diagnostic Center**: Implemented `integrityService.js` supporting diagnostic scanning across 15+ integrity rules and safe repair endpoints.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/scripts/test_phase17_master_data.js`. All 15/15 automated unit, safety guard, and integrity diagnostic tests passed successfully (100% pass rate).
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 15) — System Activity & Audit Center**
  * **Objective**: Built a centralized operational activity and audit logging system (`activity_log`) recording action, module, entityType, actor, hostel, and sanitized metadata.
  * **Security & Sanitization**: Stripped secrets/tokens and masked sensitive identification fields.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/scripts/test_phase15_activity.js`. All audit tests passed successfully.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 11) — Hostel Fees & Payment Management System**
  * **Objective**: Implemented the complete financial tracking, fee structure management, student fee assignment, transaction-safe payment recording with receipt generation, fee waivers, and financial analytics.
  * **Database Architecture**: Added four new tables (`fee_structures`, `student_fees`, `fee_payments`, `fee_history`) in `schema.sql` and `migrations/phase11_fees.sql`.
  * **Financial & Data Safety**: Handled monetary values as `DECIMAL(10,2)`, transaction-safe payment recording, receipt generation (`FEE-YYYY-XXXXXX`), and status tracking (`PENDING`, `PARTIAL`, `PAID`, `OVERDUE`, `WAIVED`).
  * **Security & IDOR Protections**: Enforced Super Admin waiver permissions, derived student IDs strictly from JWT sessions, and blocked cross-student data viewing.
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Built `FeeSummaryCards.jsx`, `FeeCard.jsx`, `FeeStructureModal.jsx`, `AssignFeeModal.jsx`, `RecordPaymentModal.jsx`, `FeeWaiverModal.jsx`, `FeeReceiptModal.jsx`, `FeeDetailsModal.jsx`, and `FeeManagementPage.jsx`.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/test_phase11_fees.js`. All 17/17 automated financial audit tests passed successfully.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 10) — Hostel Mess & Food Management System**
  * **Objective**: Designed and implemented end-to-end Mess & Food Management allowing staff to publish daily/weekly menus, track meal attendance (TAKING / NOT_TAKING), enforce meal cutoff rules, view mess analytics, and handle mess complaints.
  * **Database Tables**: Added `mess_menus` and `meal_attendance` tables with composite unique constraints `(hostel_id, menu_date, meal_type)` and `(student_id, meal_date, meal_type)`. Indexed `(hostel_id, menu_date)` and `(student_id, meal_date)`.
  * **Business & Security Logic**: Created `messService.js`, `messController.js`, and `messRoutes.js`. Built role-based menu scoping (Super Admin multi-hostel/common, Superintendent assigned hostels, Student read-only/own hostel). Derived `student_id` strictly from JWT session for IDOR protection. Implemented cutoff enforcement.
  * **Complaints Integration**: Integrated with existing `complaints` table under category `FOOD_MESS`.
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Developed `MealCard.jsx`, `WeeklyMenu.jsx` (desktop table grid & mobile accordion), `MenuFormModal.jsx`, `MessAnalyticsCard.jsx`, `RecentMessSection.jsx`, and `MessPage.jsx`. Connected Sidebar navigation and embedded widgets into Admin, Superintendent, and Student dashboards.
  * **Verification**: Authored `backend/src/test_phase10_mess.js`. All 10/10 automated tests passed successfully. Verified production build using `npm run build`.
  * **Status**: Complete.

* **2026-08-23 (Phase 9) — Hostel Visitor Management System**
  * **Objective**: Built a secure, role-based visitor tracking workflow (REQUESTED → APPROVED → CHECKED_IN → CHECKED_OUT) with strict IDOR protections and privacy compliance.
  * **Database Tables**: Created `visits` and `visitor_history` with foreign key constraints and indexes on `(hostel_id, status)`, `(student_id, visit_date)`, `(status, expected_check_out)`.
  * **Privacy Compliance**: Enforced `identification_type` + `identification_last4` storage. Sensitive document numbers (e.g., Aadhaar/SSN) are masked.
  * **Backend Service**: Developed `visitorService.js`, `visitorController.js`, and `visitorRoutes.js`. Implemented student profile automatic derivation, superintendent hostel scoping, and status state machine guards.
  * **Frontend UI Components**: Built `VisitorCard.jsx`, `VisitorFormModal.jsx`, `VisitorDetailsModal.jsx`, `RecentVisitorsSection.jsx`, and `VisitorsPage.jsx` with real-time status tabs and search filtering.
